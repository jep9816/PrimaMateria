  <h3><a href="index.html">Index</a></h3>
  <p>The possible locations around an <a href="atom.html">atom</a>
  where <a href="electron.html">electrons</a> having specific
  energy values (<a href="quantumNumber.html">quantum number</a>)
  may be found. The term shell has been replaced with the term
  energy levels because the term shell insinuated that electrons
  circled the atom in fixed orbits like planets circle the sun.
  This model however is incorrect and outdated. Although the term
  shell is outdated, it is still often used grade school and high
  school science classes, as its concepts are less intimidating
  than are the use of terms like quantum number.</p>
