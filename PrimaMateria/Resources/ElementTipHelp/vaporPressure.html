  <h3><a href="index.html">Index</a></h3>

  <p>The pressure exerted when a material in its solid or liquid
  state is in equilibrium with it's gas state. As this is changes
  as a function of temperature, vapor pressure must be qualified by
  the relevant temperature.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">s</span> - Indicated the
    substance is a solid at this temperature.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">e</span> - Indicated an
    extrapolation beyond the region where experimental measurements
    exist.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">i</span> - Indicated the
    value was calculated from ideal gas thermodynamic functions,
    sucah as those in the <span style="font-style: italic;">JANAF
    Thermodynamic tables</span>.</li>
