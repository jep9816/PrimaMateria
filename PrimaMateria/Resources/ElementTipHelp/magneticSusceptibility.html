    Magnetic Susceptibility

  <h3><a href="index.html">Index</a></h3>
  <p>When a material is placed in a magnetic field <span class=
  "emphasized">H</span>, a magnetization (magnetic moment per unit
  volume) <span class="emphasized">M</span> is induced in the
  material which is related to <span class="emphasized">H</span> by
  <span class="emphasized">M</span> = <span class=
  "greek">κ</span><span class="emphasized">H</span> where
  <span class="greek">κ</span> is called the volume susceptibility.
  Since <span class="emphasized">H</span> and <span class=
  "emphasized">M</span> have the same dimensions, <span class=
  "greek">κ</span> is dimensionless. A more useful paremeter the
  the molar susceptibility <span class=
  "greek">Χ</span><sub>m</sub>, defined by</p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <span class="greek">Χ</span><sub>m</sub> = <span class=
    "greek">κ</span><span class="italic">V</span><sub>m</sub> =
    <span class="greek">Φ</span><span class=
    "italic">M</span>/<span class="greek"><sub>Ρ</sub></span>
  </div>
  <p>where <span class="italic">V</span><sub>m</sub> is the molar
  volume of the substance, <span class="italic">M</span> the molar
  mass, and <span class="greek">Ρ</span> the mass density. When the
  cgs system is used, the customary units for <span class=
  "greek">Χ</span><sub>m</sub> are cm<sup>3</sup>mol<sup>-1</sup>;
  the corresponding SI units are m<sup>3</sup>mol<sup>-1.</sup></p>
  <p>Substances that have no unpaired <a href=
  "electron.html">electron</a> <a href="orbital.html">orbital</a>
  or spin angular momentum generally have negative values of
  <span class="greek">Χ</span><sub>m</sub> and are called
  diamagnetic. Their molar susceptibility varies only slightly with
  temperature. Substances with unpaired electrons, which are termed
  paramagnetic, have positive <span class=
  "greek">Χ</span><sub>m</sub> and show a much stronger temperature
  dependance, varing roughly as 1/<span class="italic">T</span>.
  The net susceptibility of a paramagnetic substance is the sum of
  the paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions, but the former
  almost always dominates.</p>
