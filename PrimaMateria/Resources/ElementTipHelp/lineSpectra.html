  <p>In the 19th Century, some experiments showed that the
  structure of atoms must be far more complicated than had been
  previously believed. These experiments investigated the behavior
  of atoms excited in an electric discharge. When hydrogen and
  other gases such as helium are heated, the atoms absorb excess
  energy and the electrons undergo a transition from the lowest
  energy level, to a higher energy level. When the electrons fall
  from this higher energy level back down to the lower energy
  level, a photon of light is emitted. Each photon of light has a
  definite energy and a characteristic color. This emitted light is
  called the atomic spectrum (plural, spectra).</p>

  <p>Passing the emitted light through a prism separates it into
  beams, each of a single wavelength and color. Prisms separate
  light by refracting it; when light of different wavelengths pass
  through a prism, it is bent at different angles. The fact that
  excited atoms emit light of only certain discrete wavelengths is
  evidence that their internal structure must be complex, otherwise
  there would be no reason why light of every wavelength is not
  emitted.</p>

  <p>The information in the line spectra list is limited to the
  visible light spectrum. There are many more lines not shown in
  this list that are outside of human visibility.</p>
