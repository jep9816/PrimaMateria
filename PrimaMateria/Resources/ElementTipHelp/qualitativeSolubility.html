    Qualitative Solubility

  <p>The solubility of a substance is often given a relative
  reference. We may say a substance is soluble or it is insoluble.
  No substance in fact is either perfectly soluble or insoluble .
  Chemists generally agree that insoluble means that the solubility
  of the solid is less that 1 gram per liter. (approximately 0.01 -
  0.1 moles per liter).</p>

  <p>Some combinations of ions (ionic solids) have differing
  degrees of attraction for each other and therefore are not all
  equal in their abilities to dissolve. Chemists unfortunately have
  no reliable way of predicting theoretically what combination of
  ions (ionic compound) will have greater or lesser attractions and
  therefore be soluble or insoluble. Chemists therefore through
  experimentation, have determined certain patterns in the
  solubility of various ionic substances.</p>
