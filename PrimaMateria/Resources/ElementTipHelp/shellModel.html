    Shell Model

  <h3><a href="index.html">Index</a></h3>

  <p>In nuclear physics, the nuclear shell model is a model of the
  atomic <a href="nucleus.html">nucleus</a>. It is analogous to the
  atomic shell model that is more familiar to those who have
  studied basic physics. Recall that in the atomic shell model, the
  <a href="electron.html">electrons</a> populate shells, and once a
  shell is filled, there is a significant drop in the binding
  energy for the next electron added.</p>

  <p>It is similar for the nuclear shell model. When adding
  nucleons (<a href="proton.html">protons</a> or <a href=
  "neutron.html">neutrons</a>) to a nucleus, there are certain
  points where the binding energy of the next nucleon is
  significantly less than the last one. This observation, that
  there are certain magic numbers of nucleons: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50,
  82, 126 which are more tightly bound than the next higher number,
  that are the origin of the shell model.</p>

  <p>Note that the shells exist for both protons and neutrons
  individually, so that we can speak of "magic nuclei" where one
  nucleon type is at a magic number, and "doubly magic nuclei",
  where both are. Due to some variations in orbital filling, the
  upper magic numbers are 126 and, speculatively, 184 for neutrons
  but only 114 for protons. This has a relevant role in the search
  of the so-called island of stability. Besides, there have been
  found some semimagic numbers, noticeably Z=40.</p>

  <p>In order to get these numbers, the nuclear shell model starts
  from an average potential with a shape something between the
  square well and the harmonic oscillator. To this potential a
  relativistic spin orbit term is added. Even so, the total
  perturbation does not coincide with experiment, and an empirical
  spin orbit coupling, named Nilsson Term, must be added with at
  least two or three different values of its coupling constant,
  depending of the nuclei being studied.</p>
