  <p>Energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. Different forms
  of radiation comprise the electromagnetic spectrum and are
  characterized by their different wave frequency and wavelength.
  Radiation is emitted from matter in the form of <a href=
  "photon.html">photons</a>. The following types of radiation make
  up the electromagnetic spectrum (in order of decreasing energy
  and increasing wavelength): cosmic rays, gamma rays, x-rays, UV
  (ultraviolet) rays, visible light rays, infrared, microwave,
  radio (Hertzian) waves and electric waves. These electromagnetic
  waves have no mass and are not electrically charged. The shortest
  wavelength forms of radiation are most penetrating and are the
  most damaging to living tissue.</p>
