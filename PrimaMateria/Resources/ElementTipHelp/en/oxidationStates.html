        Oxidation State (Oxidation Number)

    <p>Either the actual charge of an <a href="atom.html">atom</a> (ion) in a
    substance, assuming the atom exists as a monatomic ion, or a hypothetical
    charge assigned by simple rules. 2) The charge an atom would have in a
    substance if the pairs of <a href="electron.html">electrons</a> in each
    bond belonged to the more <a href=
    "electroNegativity.html">electronegative</a> atom. 3) The number of
    electrons that must be added or subtracted from an atom in a combined state
    to convert it to the elemental form.</p>
    <p>Generally the following rules for assigning oxidation numbers to an atom
    can be used:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In its elementary state the oxidation number of an atom is zero.
        For instance the oxidation number for chlorine Cl2 or oxygen O2 is
        zero.</li>
        <li>All <a href="group.html">Group</a> IA (<a href=
        "alkaliMetal.html">alkali metals</a>) elements have an oxidation number
        of +1 in any compound. All Group IIA (alkali earth metals) elements
        have an oxidation number of +2 in any compound.</li>
        <li>Fluorine has an oxidation number of -1 in all of its
        compounds.</li>
        <li>Chlorine, bromine and iodine have an oxidation number of -1 in any
        compound of halogen with a less electronegative element.</li>
        <li>Usually oxygen has an oxidation number of -2 in a compound.
        Peroxides, like H2O2 and Na2O2, are the major exceptions to this and in
        these cases oxygen has an oxidation number of -1.</li>
        <li>Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 in most of its compounds. In
        hydrides (compounds like NaH), however, in which hydrogen is bonded to
        metallic <a href="element.html">elements</a>, hydrogen has an oxidation
        number of -1.</li>
        <li>The sum of the oxidation numbers of the atoms in a compound always
        equals zero. For polyatomic ions, the oxidation numbers of the atoms
        add up to the charge of the ion.</li>
    </ol>
