        Qualitative Solubility

    <p>The solubility of a substance is often given a relative reference. We
    may say a substance is soluble or it is insoluble. No substance in fact is
    either perfectly soluble or insoluble . Chemists generally agree that
    insoluble means that the solubility of the solid is less that 1 gram per
    liter. (approximately 0.01 - 0.1 moles per liter).</p>
    <p>Some combinations of ions (ionic solids) have differing degrees of
    attraction for each other and therefore are not all equal in their
    abilities to dissolve. Chemists unfortunately have no reliable way of
    predicting theoretically what combination of ions (ionic compound) will
    have greater or lesser attractions and therefore be soluble or insoluble.
    Chemists therefore through experimentation, have determined certain
    patterns in the solubility of various ionic substances.</p>
