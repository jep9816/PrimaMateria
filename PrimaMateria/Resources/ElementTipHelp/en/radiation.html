    <p>Energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. Different forms of
    radiation comprise the electromagnetic spectrum and are characterized by
    their different wave frequency and wavelength. Radiation is emitted from
    matter in the form of <a href="photon.html">photons</a>. The following
    types of radiation make up the electromagnetic spectrum (in order of
    decreasing energy and increasing wavelength): cosmic rays, gamma rays,
    x-rays, UV (ultraviolet) rays, visible light rays, infrared, microwave,
    radio (Hertzian) waves and electric waves. These electromagnetic waves have
    no mass and are not electrically charged. The shortest wavelength forms of
    radiation are most penetrating and are the most damaging to living
    tissue.</p>
