        Orbital Theory

    <h3><a href="index.html">Index</a></h3>
    <p>The <a href="quantum.html">quantum</a> theory of matter that combines
    Schrodinger's wave mechanics and Heisenburg's uncertainty principle and
    applies this to the behavior and nature of <a href=
    "electron.html">electrons</a>. Orbital theory was formulated in 1926 and
    has yielded a better understanding of electrons and their critical role in
    chemical bonding than is possible with Newtonian mechanics.</p>
    <p>The primary orbits are numbered from 1 to 7 from the <a href=
    "nucleus.html">nucleus</a> outwards. Secondary orbits are given the letters
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">s, p, d, f</span> (derived respectively
    from the words <span style="font-weight: bold;">sharp, principle, diffuse
    and fundamental</span>, used to describe the lines in the spectrum
    corresponding to electrons moving in and out of the orbits).</p>
