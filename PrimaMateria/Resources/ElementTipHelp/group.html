  <h3><a href="index.html">Index</a></h3>

  <p>The vertical columns (major classes or divisions) into which
  <a href="element.html">elements</a> are arranged in the <a href=
  "periodicTable.html">periodic table</a> of elements. There are
  three common numbering systems for these groups:</p>

  <p>The new <a href="iopac.html">IUPAC</a> system, which numbers
  each column with Arabic numbers from 1 (one) through 18
  (eighteen).</p>

  <p>The old IUPAC system, which labeled columns with Roman
  numerals followed by either the letter 'A' or 'B'. Columns were
  numbed such that columns one through seven were numbered 'IA'
  through 'VIIA', columns 8 through 10 were labeled 'VIIIA',
  columns 11 through 17 were numbered 'IB' through 'VIIB' and
  column 18 was numbered 'VIII'.</p>

  <p>The <a href="cas.html">CAS system</a>, which also used Roman
  numerals followed by an 'A' or 'B'. This method, however, labeled
  columns 1 and 2 as 'IA' and 'IIA', columns 3 through 7 as 'IIIB'
  through 'VIB', column 8 through 10 as 'VIII', columns 11 and 12
  as 'IB' and 'IIB' and columns 13 through 18 as 'IIIA' through
  'VIIIA'.</p>

  <p>Because of the confusion the old IUPAC and the CAS system
  created, the IUPAC adopted their new system.</p>

  <p>Elements are arranged in these groups according to whose
  proprieties are similar. All elements in Group 1 for instance are
  <a href="alkaliMetal.html">alkali metals</a>. They have only one
  <a href="electron.html">electron</a> in the outer shell (valence
  electron) and as a result are highly reactive. Elements in Group
  17 are the <a href="halogen.html">halogens</a>. They all have
  seven electrons in the outer <a href="orbital.html">orbital</a>
  (two in level s and five in level p). They are also very reactive
  because they have seven electrons in the outer shell and will
  readily accept an electron in order to reach the ion
  configuration with the ideal number of eight electrons in the
  outer shell. Elements Group 18 have a complete outer shell with
  eight electrons. These <a href="nobleGas.html">noble gases</a>
  are highly stable and do not react to form compounds under normal
  conditions.</p>
