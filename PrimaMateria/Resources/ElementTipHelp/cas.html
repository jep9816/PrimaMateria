  <p>CAS is a team of scientists, creating and delivering the most
  complete and effective digital information environment for
  scientific research and discovery. CAS provides pathways to
  published research in the world's journal and patent
  literature--virtually everything relevant to chemistry plus a
  wealth of information in the life sciences and a wide range of
  other scientific disciplines--back to the beginning of the 20th
  century.</p>

  <p>Since 1907, CAS has indexed and summarized chemistry-related
  articles from more than 40,000 scientific journals, in addition
  to patents, conference proceedings and other documents pertinent
  to chemistry, life sciences and many other fields. In total,
  abstracts for more than 24 million documents are accessible
  online through CAS.</p>
