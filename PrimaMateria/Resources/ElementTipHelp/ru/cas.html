    <p>CAS is a team of scientists, creating and delivering the most complete
    and effective digital information environment for scientific research and
    discovery. CAS provides pathways to published research in the world's
    journal and patent literature--virtually everything relevant to chemistry
    plus a wealth of information in the life sciences and a wide range of other
    scientific disciplines--back to the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>Since 1907, CAS has indexed and summarized chemistry-related articles
    from more than 40,000 scientific journals, in addition to patents,
    conference proceedings and other documents pertinent to chemistry, life
    sciences and many other fields. In total, abstracts for more than 24
    million documents are accessible online through CAS.</p>
