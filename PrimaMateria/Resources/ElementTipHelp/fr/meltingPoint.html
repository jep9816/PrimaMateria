    <p>The point at which the crystals of a pure substance are in equilibrium
    with the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure. This point is commonly
    referred to as melting point when a substance is approaching it from its
    solid state and is referred to as freezing point when a substance is
    approaching it from its liquid state.</p>
