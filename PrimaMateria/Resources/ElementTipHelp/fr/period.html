    <p>While <a href="group.html">groups</a> are characterized by the number of
    <a href="electron.html">electrons</a> present in the outer shell, periods
    are characterized by the number of energy levels (shells) of electrons
    surrounding the <a href="nucleus.html">nucleus</a>. <a href=
    "element.html">Elements</a> in Period 1 has only one shell. As you probably
    recall, the elements in the first period have a 2 electrons maximum
    (hydrogen has 1 electron and helium has 2 electrons. As we move to the
    first group of the second period, we find that lithium, which has the two
    electrons in the first shell and one in the second. Neon is in Group 18 of
    Period 2 and therefore has the two electrons in the first shell and eight
    electrons in the second shell. Sodium starts Period 3 with 11 electrons,
    two in the first shell, eight in the second shell and one in the third
    shell. In other words, the element in Group 1 always has one more electron
    (in a new shell) than the Group 18 element in the previous period.</p>
