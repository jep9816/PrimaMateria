  <p>A particle of matter that has a mass of 1.009 amu but no
  electrical charge. These particles are constituents of the
  <a href="nucleus.html">nucleus</a> of all elements except for
  hydrogen (H). Neutrons can exist in a free state. Because
  neutrons have no electrical charge, free neutrons have great
  penetrating capabilities and are highly damaging to living
  tissue.</p>
