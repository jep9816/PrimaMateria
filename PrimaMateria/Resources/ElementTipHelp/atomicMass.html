    Atomic Mass
  </div>
  <h3><a href="index.html">Index</a></h3>
  <p>The average mass of all <a href="nuclide.html">nuclides</a> of
  an <a href="element.html">element</a> determined by the
  proportions in which each nuclide of the element are present
  within the earth and its atmosphere. The Standard Atomic Weights
  apply to the elements as they exist naturally on Earth, and the
  uncertainties take into account the isotopic variation found in
  most laboratory samples. Further comments on the variablility are
  given in the footnotes.</p>
  <p>The number in parentheses following the atomic weight value
  gives the uncercainty in the last digit.</p>
  <p>An atomic weight entry in brakets indicates that the element
  has no stable isotopes; the value given is atomic mass in
  <strong>u</strong> (or the mass number, if the mass is not
  accuratly known) for the isotope of the longests half-life.</p>
  <p>Thorium, Portactinium and Uranium have no stable isotopes, but
  the terrestrial isotopic composition is sufficiently uniform to
  permit a standard atomic weight to be specified.</p>
  <p>Footnotes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>a:</strong> No stable isotope exists. The atomic
    mass in <strong>u</strong> (or the mass number, if the mass is
    not accuratly known) for the isotope of the longests
    half-life.</li>
    <li><strong>b:</strong> Commecially available Li materials have
    atomic weights that range between 6.939 and 6.996; if a more
    accurate value is reguired, it must be determined for the
    specific material.</li>
    <li><strong>g:</strong> Geological specimens are known in which
    the element has an isotopic composition outside the limits for
    the normal material. The difference between the atomic weight
    of the element in such specimens and that given, may exceed the
    stated uncertainty.</li>
    <li><strong>m:</strong> Modified isotopic compositions may be
    found in commercially availabble material because it has been
    subject to an undisclosed or inadvertent isotopic
    fractionation. Substantial deviations in atomic weight of that
    given can occur.</li>
    <li><strong>r:</strong> Range in istopic composition of normal
    terrestrial material prevents a more precise atomic weight
    being given; the tabulated value should be applicable to any
    normal material.</li>
