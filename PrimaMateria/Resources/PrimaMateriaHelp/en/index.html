    <p><strong>Prima Materia</strong> is the primitive formless
    base of all matter, according to Aristotle and the Alchemists,
    given particular manifestation through the influence of forms.
    According to the latter, lead could be turned to gold by
    reducing it to prima materia and imposing the form of gold on
    it.<br />
    <br />
    In the broadest terms the concept of the prima materia states
    that all particular substances are formed out of one and the
    same original substance. Considered in this way it becomes
    apparent that, in one form or another, this is a universal
    concept, possibly of an archetypal nature. The most prevalent
    notion of the prima materia to be found in modern thought is
    the atomistic theory which we inherited from the ancient
    Greeks. In this conception all material structures are composed
    of tiny building blocks of indestructible 'substance'. This
    substance is considered to be pure matter, and in an entirely
    materialistic paradigm this equates naturally to the concept of
    the prima materia.<br />
    <br />
    As modern quantum science has begun to cast some doubt upon the
    veracity of the atomic theory, universal field theories have
    arisen to take its place. In Descartes' philosophy of radical
    doubt the prima materia is knowledge or perception (including
    the inner perception of one's own mind) because the existence
    of an objective reality corresponding to our perceptions can
    never be demonstrated. In eastern cultures the mind is
    conceived as being the single substance out of which everything
    was formed. In religious cultures god and spirit perform this
    function. Given the variety of forms in which it appears it is
    uncertain whether the prevalence of this concept is founded in
    its objective reality or the structure of the human mind
    itself. Its existence is intimately linked to our need to
    understand the ultimate or absolute truth of our reality and to
    the folly of our quest for the 'theory of everything'.
