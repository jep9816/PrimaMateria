        <p>One of the most striking facts about the elements is their unequal
        distribution and occurrence in nature. Present knowledge of the
        chemical composition of the universe, obtained from the study of the
        spectra of stars and nebulae, indicates that hydrogen is by far the
        most abundant element and may account for more than 90% of the atoms or
        about 75% of the mass of the universe. Helium atoms make up most of the
        remainder. All of the other elements together contribute only slightly
        to the total mass.</p><br />
        <p>The chemical composition of the universe is undergoing continuous
        change. Hydrogen is being converted into helium, and helium is being
        changed into heavier elements. As time goes on, the ratio of heavier
        elements increases relative to hydrogen. Presumably, the process is not
        reversible. Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle, and more recently,
        Peebles, Penzias, and others have studied the synthesis of elements in
        stars. To explain all of the features of the nuclear abundance curve -
        obtained by studies of the composition of the earth, meteorites, stars,
        etc. - it is necessary to postulate that the elements were originally
        formed by at least eight different processes: (1) hydrogen burning, (2)
        helium burning, (3) c process, (4) e process, (5) s process, (6) r
        process, (7) p process, and (8) the X process. The X process is thought
        to account for the existence of light nuclei such as D, Li, Be, and B.
        Common metals such as Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu, Ti, Zn, etc. were likely produced
        early in the history of our galaxy. It is also probable that most of
        the heavy elements on earth and elsewhere in the universe were
        originally formed in supernovae, or in the hot interior of stars.
        Studies of the solar spectrum have led to the identification of 67
        elements in the sun's atmosphere; however, all elements cannot be
        identified with the same degree of certainty. Other elements may be
        present in the sun, although they have not yet been detected
        spectroscopically. The element helium was discovered on the sun before
        it was found on earth. Some elements such as scandium are relatively
        more plentiful in the sun and stars than here on earth.</p><br />
        <p>Minerals in lunar rocks brought back from the moon on the Apollo
        missions consist predominantly of plagioclase {(Ca,Na)(Al,Si)O4O8} and
        pyroxene {(Ca,Mg,Fe)2Si2O6} - two minerals common in terrestrial
        volcanic rock. No new elements have been found on the moon that cannot
        be accounted for on earth; however, three minerals, armalcolite
        {(Fe,Mg)Ti2O5}, pyroxferroite {CaFe6(SiO3)7}, and tranquillityite
        {Fe8(Zr,Y)Ti3Si3O2}, are new. The oldest known terrestrial rocks are
        about 4 billion years old. One rock, known as the "Genesis Rock,"
        brought back from the Apollo 15 Mission, is about 4.15 billion years
        old. This is only about one-half billion years younger than the
        supposed age of the moon and solar system. Lunar rocks appear to be
        relatively enriched in refractory elements such as chromium, titanium,
        zirconium, and the rare earths, and impoverished in volatile elements
        such as the alkali metals, in chlorine, and in noble metals such as
        nickel, platinum, and gold. Even older than the "Genesis Rock" are
        carbonaceous chondrites, a type of meteorite that has fallen to earth
        and has been studied. These are some of the most primitive objects of
        the solar system yet found. The grains making up these objects probably
        condensed directly out the gaseous nebula from which the sun and
        planets were born. Most of the condensation of the grains probably was
        completed within 50,000 years of the time the disk of the nebula was
        first formed - about 4.6 billion years ago. It is now thought that this
        type of meteorite may contain a small percentage of presolar dust
        grains. The relative abundances of the elements of these meteorites are
        about the same as the abundances found in the solar chromosphere. The
        X-ray fluorescent spectrometer sent with the Viking I spacecraft to
        Mars shows that the Martian soil contains about 12 to 16% iron, 14 to
        15% silicon, 3 to 8% calcium, 2 to 7% aluminum, and one-half to 2%
        titanium. The gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer on Viking II found
        no trace of organic compounds that should be present if life ever
        existed there.</p><br />
        <p>F. W. Clarke and others have carefully studied the composition of
        rocks making up the crust of the earth. Oxygen accounts for about 47%
        of the crust, by weight, while silicon comprises about 28% and aluminum
        about 8%. These elements, plus iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and
        magnesium, account for about 99% of the composition of the
        crust.</p><br />
        <p>Many elements such as tin, copper, zinc, lead, mercury, silver,
        platinum, antimony, arsenic, and gold, which are so essential to our
        needs and civilization, are among some of the rarest elements in the
        earth's crust. These are made available to us only by the processes of
        concentration in ore bodies. Some of the so-called rare-earth elements
        have been found to be much more plentiful than originally thought and
        are about as abundant as uranium, mercury, lead, or bismuth. The least
        abundant rare-earth or lanthanide element, thulium, is now believed to
        be more plentiful on earth than silver, cadmium, gold, or iodine, for
        example. Rubidium, the 16th most abundant element, is more plentiful
        than chlorine while its compounds are little known in chemistry and
        commerce.</p><br />
        <p>It is now thought that at least 24 elements are essential to living
        matter. The four most abundant in the human body are hydrogen, oxygen,
        carbon, and nitrogen. The seven next most common, in order of
        abundance, are calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, sulfur,
        sodium, and magnesium. Iron, copper, zinc, silicon, iodine, cobalt,
        manganese, molybdenum, fluorine, tin, chromium, selenium, and vanadium
        are needed and play a role in living matter. Boron is also thought
        essential for some plants, and it is possible that aluminum, nickel,
        and germanium may turn out to be necessary. Ninety-one elements occur
        naturally on earth. Minute traces of plutonium-244 have been discovered
        in rocks mined in Southern California. This discovery supports the
        theory that heavy elements were produced during creation of the solar
        system. While technetium and promethium have not yet been found
        naturally on earth, they have been found to be present in stars.
        Technetium has been identified in the spectra of certain "late" type
        stars, and promethium lines have been identified in the spectra of a
        faintly visible star HR465 in Andromeda. Promethium must have been made
        very recently near the star's surface for no known isotope of this
        element has a half-life longer than 17.7 years.</p><br />
        <p>It has been suggested that californium is present in certain stellar
        explosions known as supernovae; however, this has not been proved. At
        present no elements are found elsewhere in the universe that cannot be
        accounted for here on earth.</p><br />
        <p>All atomic mass numbers from 1 to 238 are found naturally on earth
        except for masses 5 and 8. About 285 relatively stable and 67 naturally
        radioactive isotopes occur on earth totaling 352. In addition, the
        neutron, technetium, promethium, and the transuranic elements (lying
        beyond uranium) up to Element 112 have been produced artificially.
        Scientists at G.S.I., Darmstadt, Germany, in February, 1996, reported
        they had found evidence of an isotope of Element 112. Laboratory
        processes have now extended the radioactive element mass numbers beyond
        238 to 277. Each element from atomic numbers 1 to 108 is known to have
        at least one radioactive isotope. As of January 1996, 3018 isotopes and
        isomers were thought to be known and recognized. Many stable and
        radioactive isotopes are now produced and distributed by the Oak Ridge
        National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A., to customers licensed by
        the U.S. Department of Energy.</p><br />
        <p>The nucleus of an atom is characterized by the number of protons it
        contains, denoted by Z, and by the number of neutrons, N. Isotopes of
        an element have the same value of Z, but different values of N. The
        mass number A, is the sum of Z and N. For example, Uranium-238 has a
        mass number of 238, and contains 92 protons and 146 neutrons.</p><br />
        <p>There is evidence that the definition of chemical elements must be
        broadened to include the electron. Several compounds known as
        electrides, have recently been made of alkaline metal elements and
        electrons. A relatively stable combination of a positron and electron,
        known as positronium, has also been studied.</p><br />
        <p>In addition to the proton, neutron, and electron, there are
        considerably more than 100 other fundamental particles which have been
        discovered or hypothesized. The majority of these fall into one of two
        classes, leptons or hadrons. The leptons comprise just four known
        particles, the electron, the muon (m meson), and two kinds of
        neutrinos. The muon is essentially similar to the electron and has a
        charge of +1, but it is 200 times heavier. The neutrino is either of
        two stable particles of small (probably zero) rest mass, carrying no
        charge. Also there are four antileptons, identical to the corresponding
        leptons in some respects, such as mass, but they have properties
        exactly opposite those of the leptons. The positron, for example, is an
        antilepton, with a charge of +1. Leptons cannot be broken into smaller
        units and are considered to be elementary. On the other hand, hadrons
        are complex and thought to have internal structure. Protons and
        neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei, are hadrons.</p><br />
        <p>Elementary particle physics is not yet clearly understood, but
        groupings and arrangements of these particles have been made resembling
        the periodic table of chemical elements. This has led to the
        speculation that hadrons are composed of simpler components called
        quarks. Quarks are presumed to be elementary particles. Quarks come in
        a variety of "flavors". Two kinds of quarks - up and down - combine to
        form the protons and neutrons of ordinary matter. Three other quarks,
        known as {strange", "charm", and "bottom", are found in particle
        accelerators, and one of these may exist in the center of very dense,
        massive stars. Theorists have thought that a sixth "top" quark, much
        more massive than the others, should exist to complete the quark family
        of sub-atomic particles. In 1994, scientists using Fermilab's Tevatron
        accelerator may have "glimpsed" to top quark. There is presently no
        evidence that quarks exist in isolation. Many physicists now hold that
        all the matter and energy in the universe is controlled by four
        fundamental natural forces: the electromagnetic force, gravity, a weak
        nuclear force, and a strong nuclear force. Each of these natural forces
        is passed back and forth among the basic particles of matter by unique
        force-carrying particles. The electromagnetic force is carried by the
        photon, the weak nuclear force by the intermediate vector boson, and
        gravity by the gravitron. There is now evidence of the existence of a
        particle, known as the gluon, that binds quarks together by carrying
        the strong nuclear force. Hadrons are thought to be particles composed
        of quarks and gluons.</p><br />
        <p>The available evidence leads to the conclusion that elements 89
        (actinium) through 103 (lawrencium) are chemically similar to the
        rare-earth or lanthanide elements (elements 57 to 71, inclusive). These
        elements therefore have been named actinides after the first member of
        this series. Those elements beyond uranium that have been produced
        artificially have the following names and symbols: neptunium, 93 (Np);
        plutonium, 94 (Pu); americium, 95 (Am); curium, 96 (Cm); berkelium, 97
        (Bk); californium, 98 (Cf); einsteinium, 99 (Es); fermium, 100 (Fm);
        mendelevium, 101 (Md); nobelium, 102 (No); and lawrencium, 103 (Lr). It
        is now claimed that Elements 104 through 112 have been produced and
        identified. In August 1997, the International Union of Pure and Applied
        Chemistry (IUPAC) gave final approval to the following names for
        elements 104 to 109: element 104 - rutherfordium (Rf); element 105 -
        dubnium (Db); element 106 - seaborgium (Sg); element 107 - bohrium
        (Bh); element 108 - hassium (Hs); and element 109 - meitnerium (Mt).
        Elements beyond this may be designated by temporary names: ununnilium
        (Uun) for 110, unununium (Uuu) for 111, ununbium (Uub) for 112,
        etc.</p><br />
        <p>Element 104 is expected to have chemical properties similar to those
        of hafnium and would not be a member of the actinide series. Element
        105 probably would have chemical properties similar to those of
        tantalum, Element 106 similar to tungsten, Element 107 similar to
        rhenium, and Element 109 similar to iridium, etc.</p><br />
        <p>There is still thought to be a possibility of producing elements
        beyond Element 112 either by bombardment of heavy isotopic targets with
        heavy ions, or by the irradiation of uranium or transuranic elements
        with the instantaneous high flux of neutrons produced by underground
        nuclear explosions. The limit will be set by the yields of the nuclear
        reactions and by the half-lives of radioactive decay. It has been
        suggested that Elements 102 and 103 have abnormally short lives only
        because they are in a pocket of instability, and that this region of
        instability might begin to "heal" around Element 105. If so, it may be
        possible to produce heavier isotopes with longer half-lives. It has
        also been suggested that Element 114, with a mass number of 298, and
        Element 126, with a mass number of 310, may be sufficiently stable to
        make discovery and identification possible. Searches have been made by
        workers in a number of laboratories for Element 110 and its neighboring
        elements in naturally occurring platinum. Recent studies of the xenon
        component (131Xe to 136Xe) of certain carbonaceous chondritic
        meteorites suggest that Elements 113, 114, or 115 may have been its
        progenitor. There are many claims in the literature of the existence of
        various allotropic modifications of the elements, some of which are
        based on doubtful or incomplete evidence. Also, the physical properties
        of an element may change drastically by the presence of small amounts
        of impurities. With new methods of purification, which are now able to
        produce elements with 99.9999% purity, it has been necessary to restudy
        the properties of the elements. For example, the melting point of
        thorium changes by several hundred degrees by the presence of a small
        percentage of ThO2 as an impurity. Ordinary commercial tungsten is
        brittle and can be worked only with difficulty. Pure tungsten, however,
        can be cut with a hacksaw, forged, spun, drawn, or extruded. In
        general, the value of a physical property given here applies to the
        pure element, when it is known.</p><br />
        <p>Many of the chemical elements and their compounds are toxic and
        should be handled with due respect and care. In recent years there has
        been a greatly increased knowledge and awareness of the health hazards
        associated with chemicals, radioactive materials, and other agents.
        Anyone working with the elements and certain of their compounds should
        become thoroughly familiar with the proper safeguards to be taken.
        Information on specific hazards and recommended exposure limits may be
        found in Section 16. Reference should be made to publications such as
