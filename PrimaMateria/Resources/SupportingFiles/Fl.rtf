About 90 atoms of flerovium have been observed: 58 were synthesized directly, and the rest were made from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
radioactive decay}} of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms have been shown to have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
mass numbers}} from 284 to 289. The most stable known {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_flerovium"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
flerovium isotope}}, flerovium-289, has a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
half-life}} of around 2.6\'a0seconds, but it is possible that this isotope may have a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_isomer"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
nuclear isomer}} with a longer half-life of 66\'a0seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of a superheavy element. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
island of stability}}, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(physics)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
doubly magic}} flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.\
