This is my take on a Periodic Table of the element application.

Should build and run on xcode 14.3

Tab based allows for the ability to choose elements and see details

When an element is choosen an "Inspector" is displayed that has a number of tabs to investigate element properties

Can choose elements by list or Periodic Table View, a graphing cpability is available to compare various selected element parameters.

A notion of preferences to change styles, colors, turn on and off splash screen and turning on and off animations is available
Preferences also has the ability to allow for localization, tap and hold Globe Icon to switch locals.

Some animation on a few element properties is implemented.


A work in progress may have a few bugs.

Enjoy
